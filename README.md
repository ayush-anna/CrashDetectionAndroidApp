# CrashDetectionAndroidApp

This is basically an android app that uses a smartphone's Gyro sensor, Accelerometer, GPS, and GSM sensor to detect a crash. It is lightweight on the smartphone's CPU. Upon detecting a crash it will start a location service that constantly gets the user's location and upon getting the location, it will send the location coordinates in the form of a link to the added contacts. If the location is not accurate or it gets a more accurate location, then it will send the location coordinates again. the location sent as the coordinates can be directly opened in google maps as a link.
